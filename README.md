# ffmveg-revamp
Made by [Couleur](https://github.com/couleurm). Fixes and qol changes are made by [Me](https://github.com/Vramuser)!!

FFmveg is a vegas script that converts a high quality into a lower quality one. So it'll be easier to playback while editing. 

Basic uses:

To use it, highlight clips on your timeline, then hit the button to activate the script so it can convert. <br>
High the clip with the "proxy-" prefix and activate the script again so it can replace the original clip. <br>
Tip! Use the "PROXY-HIGHLIGHTER.cs" script to make changing the clips easier! 

How to install: 
1. Make a folder in `Documents` titled/named `Vegas Script Menu`
2. Drag the .cs file into that folder
3. Open up vegas and goto the tools tab and scripting, and it should be there!
--------------
To make it easier to use the script. Add it to the toolbar.
Double click btw!
