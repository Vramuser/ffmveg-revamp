# FFmveg Revamp
## **Final Update**

Created by [Couleur](https://github.com/couleurm). Fixes and quality-of-life changes made by [Me](https://github.com/Vramuser)!

FFmveg is a Vegas script designed to convert high-quality video clips into lower-quality versions for easier playback during editing.

### Basic Usage:

1. **Highlight Clips**: Select the clips on your timeline that you want to convert.
2. **Activate the Script**: Click the button to run the script and convert the selected clips.
3. **Replace Original Clips**: Highlight the clips with the "proxy-" prefix and activate the script again to replace the original clips.

**Tip**: Use the "PROXY-HIGHLIGHTER.cs" script to highlight the scripts easily!

### Installation Instructions:

1. Create a folder in `Documents` named `Vegas Script Menu`.
2. Drag the `.cs` file into that folder.
3. Open Vegas, go to the Tools tab, and select Scripting. The script should appear there!

### Adding to the Toolbar:

To make the script easier to access, add it to your toolbar. Just double-click to add!
